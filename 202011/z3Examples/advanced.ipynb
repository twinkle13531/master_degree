Records and tuples are special cases of algebraic datatypes, and so are scalars (enumeration types). But algebraic datatypes are more general. They can be used to specify finite lists, trees and other recursive structures.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to declare a List in Z3Py. It is more verbose than using the SMT 2.0 front-end, but much simpler than using the Z3 C API. It consists of two phases. First, we have to declare the new datatype, its constructors and accessors. The function Datatype('List') declares a \"placeholder\" that will contain the constructors and accessors declarations. The method declare(cname, (aname, sort)+) declares a constructor named cname with the given accessors. Each accessor has an associated sort or a reference to the datatypes being declared. For example, declare('cons', ('car', IntSort()), ('cdr', List)) declares the constructor named cons that builds a new List using an integer and a List. It also declares the accessors car and cdr. The accessor car extracts the integer of a cons cell, and cdr the list of a cons cell. After all constructors were declared, we use the method create() to create the actual datatype in Z3. Z3Py makes the new Z3 declarations and constants available as slots of the new object."

Finally let f be an uninterpreted function that takes one argument of sort A and results in a value of sort A. The example illustrates how one can force an interpretation where f applied twice to x results in x again, but f applied once to x is different from x."

The basic idea behind pattern-based quantifier instantiation is in a sense straight-forward: Annotate a quantified formula using a pattern that contains all the bound variables. So a pattern is an expression (that does not contain binding operations, such as quantifiers) that contains variables bound by a quantifier. Then instantiate the quantifier whenever a term that matches the pattern is created during search. This is a conceptually easy starting point, but there are several subtleties that are important.\n\nIn the following example, the first two options make sure that Model-based quantifier instantiation engine is disabled. We also annotate the quantified formula with the pattern f(g(x)). Since there is no ground instance of this pattern, the quantifier is not instantiated, and Z3 fails to show that the formula is unsatisfiable."

The instantiation causes a fresh ground term subtype(array_of(s), array_of(t)), which enables a new instantiation. This undesirable situation is called a matching loop. Z3 uses many heuristics to break matching loops.\n\nBefore elaborating on the subtleties, we should address an important first question. What defines the terms that are created during search? In the context of most SMT solvers, and of the Simplify theorem prover, terms exist as part of the input formula, they are of course also created by instantiating quantifiers, but terms are also implicitly created when equalities are asserted. The last point means that terms are considered up to congruence and pattern matching takes place modulo ground equalities. We call the matching problem E-matching. For example, if we have the following equalities:"

Z3 integrates an efficient E-matching engine using term indexing techniques.\n\n### Multi-patterns\nIn some cases, there is no pattern that contains all bound variables and does not contain interpreted symbols. In these cases, we use multi-patterns. In the following example, the quantified formula states that f is injective. This quantified formula is annotated with the multi-pattern MultiPattern(f(x), f(y))."
