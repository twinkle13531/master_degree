## What I did
201904 : held reading session

201905 : held reading session

201907 : try KLDivergence and USetR

201908 : study Simple Particle Swarm Optimization and mutual information and held reading session

201909 : study Selective Inference

201910 : study sampling like Gibbs Sampling, MCMC and try Replica Exchange method

201911 : study and try SimulatedAnnealing

202002 : do Replica Exchange method using wheat data

202003 : making breast cancer dataset and do Population Annlealing with small data

202004 : do wrong Population Annealing

202005 : do Population Annealing

202006 : calculate Hamiltonian to do SAT or qubo, adjust ground state energy as 0, change dataset
